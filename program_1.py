# Create a program that generates a list of 100 random numbers.
# Try to handle errors by using if-statements or try-except blocks.
# You can Google how this can be done.
# Show a menu for the user that gives the following choices:

# 1. Show all data in the list (NOTE: YOU SHOULD NOT JUST PRINT THE ENTIRE LIST, e.g., print(my_list) is wrong) DONE
# 2. Sort the list in ascending order DONE
# 3. Sort the list in descending order DONE
# 4. Add a number DONE
# 5. Remove a specific number DONE
# 6. Remove the last number DONE
# 7. Remove the first number DONE
# 8. Sum all numbers

# You should try to use separate functions for each functionality.
